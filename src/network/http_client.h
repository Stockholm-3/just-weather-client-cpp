/**

 * This header provides a simple HTTP client implementation built on top of
 * the TCP client. It supports HTTP GET requests with automatic URL parsing,
 * header processing, and chunked transfer encoding support. The client
 * automatically handles connection management and response parsing.
 *
 * @note This implementation currently supports HTTP only (not HTTPS).
 *       HTTPS support would require SSL/TLS integration.

 * - Parses the URL to extract hostname, port, and path
 * - Establishes TCP connection to the server
 * - Sends HTTP/1.1 GET request with appropriate headers
 * - Receives and parses the HTTP response
 * - Handles chunked transfer encoding if present
 * - Validates the HTTP status code

 * using http_client_get_body() and http_client_get_body_size().
 *
 * @param client Pointer to the HttpClient structure
 * @param url The URL to request (e.g., "http://example.com/api/data")
 *            Supports formats: http://hostname/path, http://hostname:port/path
 * @param error Optional pointer to store error message. If not NULL and an
 *              error occurs, will be set to a dynamically allocated string
 *              describing the error. Caller must free this string.
